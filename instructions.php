<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>
	In this survey you will be asked to solve various HIPs (Human Interaction Proofs). You may find some of these difficult to read &mdash; do your best to answer
	these. You will be presented only with upper-case letters.
</p>
<p>
	You will have 10 minutes to correctly solve as many HIPs as possible. At the end of the survey, the user with the largest number of points will be awarded an
	<strong>Xbox 360 with Kinect Bundle</strong> presale order. Points are calculated with the formula
	<strong>(Number of Correct Answers)<sup>2</sup>/Total Answers</strong> &mdash; we are optimizing for accuracy (number of correct HIPs solved). If multiple
	participants tie, the winner will be determined by a drawing.
</p>
<p>
	You will be presented with 20 image HIPs randomly throughout the study. The remainder of the study will be animated HIPs.
